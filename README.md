# Mojo-quick-guide

# What is Mojo 🔥 ?
> Mojo is a new programming language that is designed to be fast, efficient, and easy to use (especially for AI). It is superset of Python and you can get a **scale** and **performance** of a language like **c++**. Similar to python syntax, but it offers a number of advantages, including:

**Performance**: Mojo is compiled to machine code, which makes it much faster than Python.

**Scalability**: Mojo can take advantage of multiple cores and GPUs, which makes it ideal for large-scale applications.

**Memory safety**: Mojo is a memory-safe language, which means that it is less likely to crash due to memory errors.

### Insights:
* Mojo is 77k faster than python in some cases.
* Python is very slow to train a model but by using Mojo we can do it very fast.


### Quick links:
* Mojo docs: [docs](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/)
* Installaion: [installation](https://developer.modular.com/download)
* Github: [github](https://github.com/modularml/mojo)

> **Community support**: use discord for error (They have trained "KapaAi"(bot) for answering your questions).


**Note⚠️**: MOJO only exists in linux machines. If you're using windows use wsl.

### How to run? 
* To run 🔥 in vscode, you need to install the mojo vs-code extension and install the mojo using install.sh script in this directory. 
* If you want to run 🔥 in jupyter notebook run this commands 

    ```python
    pip install jupyter 
    jupyter notebook
    ```

# Concepts 
## 1. Variables in 🔥
<b>We have different kinds of varaiable initialization in mojo. Let's see one by one. </b>

> **`let`** -> It's im-mutable variable, it cannot change. It directly goes runtime.

> **`var`** -> It's a mutable variable, it can change. It's specifically for runtime, it allows argument to be mutable.

> **`alias`** -> It stores the variable at compile time. It's little faster and memory efficient way. It's im-mutable.
