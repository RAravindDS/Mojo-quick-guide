## Variable types 

1. let -> constant that cannot change (immutable) (runtime)
2. var -> not a constant, can change (mutable) (runtime)
3. alias -> It stores the variable at compile time (immutable) (compile time)
            It essentially same as "let". It's highly used in packages.  
## Appendix
Compile time -> converting your code to binary 
run time -> running the code itself
