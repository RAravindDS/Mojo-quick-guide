## Loops are same as python both (for loop and while) but here let's see how to use list here 
## In mojo arrays are not exists, so we are taking a help of python to create a list here 

from python import PythonObject ## list is a python object, so we are importing PythonObject 


fn main() raises: 
    let x: PythonObject = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] ## this is a python list 
    for i in range(x.__len__()): ## we need to get the len of the python object  
        print(x[i])
