## Mojo is a modular programming, so our code should be in modular. 
## To print hellow world, will create a function. 

fn main():  # It calles the main function by default (you don't need to call it down or up)
    print("hello world")

# Or you can run like this 
let im_mutable_variable = "hello world!"

fn main2(): 
    print(im_mutable_variable)

main2()
