## let's create a function 
## fn is used to create a function 

fn main(): 
    print(addNumbers(2, 3)) 
    #There is no restriction you can have the function above or bellow, doesn't matter 

fn addNumbers(a:Int, b:Int) -> Int: 
    let c:Int = a + b
    return c 

fn addNumbers64(a:Int8, b:Int8) -> Int64: 
    let c:Int64 = a + b 
    return c
